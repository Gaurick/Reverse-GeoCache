# Reverse-GeoCache

System that uses arduino and other bits to lock a box until you “unlock” the box by going to different pre-programed gps locations.
Inspired and borrows heavily from this project,
https://learn.adafruit.com/reverse-geocache-engagement-box

Will require a box to hold everything, a GPS receiver, an Arduino or something equivilant, a hobby servo, a two line 16 character LCD screen, and some kind of power supply.

.ino has more info that's written better.
